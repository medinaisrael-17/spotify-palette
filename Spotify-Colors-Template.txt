blue - low danceability - B

Yellow -  high valence (positivity) ...? - R

violet - low valence - B

Red - hgih loudness - R

Greem - Low Loudness G 

red orange - high energy - R

blue green - low energy G 

RGB - Red Green Blue 

A true blue is (0 - red, 0-green, 255-blue)

lowering the blue number will make it darker, raising the red and green make it lighter


you know its a lighter color if it has high values for all three

darker if lower

OKAY so we can make colors on RGB scale right, so how about we make colors based on that so limiting to only three criteria but also
providing cool data right so like.


we take their decimal values, and compute it based on percentage of 255 


0.8 ====> 80% of 255 ====> 204!!


then we just need the other two values!! 

i want to do 5 colors!

184 in comparison of 128 or 656 right so i added the rgb values together to sort by shade


lets take the watermelon sugar example 

danceability: 0.548 => change it to be .54 => 54% so we'll consider everything over 50 high so R 
    => so 54% of 255 is 137 and we'll do no decimals. So then we add that our R array (i'm assuming)
        => at the end we will take the average 


lets say the percentage danceability is low like .23 => change to be .23 => 23% so we'll consider it low so Blue
    => 23% of 255 is 58.6



we'll order it like this,  0% - 25% || 25% - 50% || 50% - 75% || 75% -100%

0-25: B or G color

25-50: randomly pick between B or G

50-75: randomly pick between R or low color

75-100 pick the R

we'll ask for 50 songs and divide it up into ten and each ten will get us one color!
